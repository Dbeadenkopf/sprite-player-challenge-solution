# Gnarled Helix Coding Challenge â€“ Sprite Demo

This repository contains my implementation of the Gnarled Helix coding challenge, designed to showcase web and game development skills using React and Three.js.

The challenge involved creating a small interactive sprite demo from scratch, with the player character responding to keyboard input and animating on the screen.

Adapting to a new codebase and problem domain.

Basic UX and responsive design considerations.

# Features Implemented

React application with a Three.js-based viewport rendering a scene.

Player character sprite rendered and animated on screen.

Character moves left and right in response to keyboard input.

Stretch Goals Completed:

Player can jump.

Viewport dynamically resizes with the window.
