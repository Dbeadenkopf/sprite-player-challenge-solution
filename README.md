# Gnarled Helix Coding Challenge

Hello, and thanks for interviewing with Gnarled Helix! This 1-2 hour coding challenge is intended to assess your blend of web and game development skills.

## Skills this challenge assesses:
- React and Three library usage.
- Adaptability to new codebases.
- UX sensibilities.

## Format
Screen sharing a local code editor and browser of the candidateâ€™s choice. The candidate may freely use google and other resources during the challenge, with the exception of ChatGPT and similar tools, but including copilot if they already have it set up.

Candidates are encouraged to leverage the following libraries from NPM:
- React
- ThreeJS
- CRA or CRA + Craco
- Either three-asperite or protosprite-three.

## Goal
From scratch, use CRA to scaffold a React application that features the player character sprite moving around the screen in response to keyboard input.

Assessment Criteria
- [ ] React app, with ThreeJS-based viewport, is up and running, and rendering a scene.
- [ ] The provided (or really, any) character sprite is rendered on screen.
- [ ] The character sprite is animated.
- [ ] The character sprite runs back and forth in response to keyboard input.
- [ ] Stretch goal: the player can jump.
- [ ] Stretch goal: the viewport is dynamically resized as the page responds to changing window dimensions.
